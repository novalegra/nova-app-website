# Privacy Policy
Anna Quinlan built Nova as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by Anna Quinlan at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone uses my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, while using the Service, I may ask you to provide Nova with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to menstrual data. The information that I request will be retained on your device in HealthKit and is not collected by me in any way.

## Log Data
I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## Cookies
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly and I do not use any third-party code that utilizes cookies.

## Service Providers
I do not employ any third-party companies or individuals.

## Security
I value your trust in providing your Personal Information to Nova, and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of electronic storage, including HealthKit, is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided the app with personal information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2020-09-08
